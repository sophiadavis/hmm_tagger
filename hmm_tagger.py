# Write an program named hmm_tagger.py or HmmTagger.java that acts as an HMM by using the 
# Viterbi algorithm and the model file that you created to determine the most probable tag 
# sequence given a sequence of words/tokens. The program should read the sequence of tokens 
# from standard input, then load the model file, then use that to output a tag sequence, 
# with the corresponding words. The word sequence input will be the .pos files piped 
# through the following sed script:


# read from stdin
# load model file
# deal with unknown words
# output tag sequence with corresponding words


# Like the last assignment, you will need to deal with unknown words and their probabilities. 
# Begin with a simple estimator, using a single <UNK> token to handle this.
# 
# If you have time, check out the bookâ€™s suggestions for this in section 5.8.2. The general 
# idea is that if a word ends in -ed, it is very likely to be a VBD. If it ends in -s, it is likely to be NNS, and so on.
